# Getting Started

Option 1: Read, ask questions, and improve the docs! :-)

Option 2: Dive right into configuration files:

* [Local auth only](https://github.com/greenpau/caddy-auth-portal/blob/main/assets/conf/local/multihost/Caddyfile)
* [Local auth with registration](https://github.com/greenpau/caddy-auth-portal/blob/main/assets/conf/local/Caddyfile)
* [Mixed LDAP and local auth](https://github.com/greenpau/caddy-auth-portal/blob/main/assets/conf/ldap/Caddyfile)
* [Azure SAML auth](https://github.com/greenpau/caddy-auth-portal/blob/main/assets/conf/saml/azure/Caddyfile)

Additionally, please see issues tagged [config example](https://github.com/greenpau/caddy-auth-portal/issues?q=label%3A%22config+example%22+).

Further, [search](https://github.com/search?l=Dockerfile&q=greenpau%2Fcaddy-auth-portal&type=Code)
Github for the Dockerfile files referencing `caddy-auth-portal`. Then, see how others use it.
